- Implementation code (PyTorch/JAX/TensorFlow)
- Experimental validation plan
- Scalability and engineering constraints analysis
- Reasoning path and assumptions

## Example Usage

```python

# Load existing proposals
library = ProposalLibrary()
proposals = library.list_proposals()

# Search by keyword
optimizer_proposals = library.search_by_keyword("optimizer")
```
