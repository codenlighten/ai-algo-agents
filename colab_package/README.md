## 🎯 How to Use

### For First-Time Users:
1. Open **COLAB_QUICKSTART.md** - read the 5-minute guide
2. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
3. Upload **colab_setup.ipynb** (File → Upload notebook)
4. Runtime → Change runtime type → **GPU**
5. Runtime → Run all (Ctrl+F9)
6. Wait 1.5-2 hours for training to complete

### For Detailed Setup:
1. Read **COLAB_SETUP.md** for full understanding
2. Follow the workflow recommendations by week
3. Set up Google Drive for checkpoint persistence
4. Monitor GPU with the built-in cells

## 💰 Cost Summary

| Tier | GPU | VRAM | Cost/Month | Best For |
|------|-----|------|------------|----------|
| **Free** | T4 | 15GB | $0 | Week 1-2 (49M/125M models) |
| **Pro** | V100 | 16GB | $10 | Week 1-2 (faster training) |
| **Pro+** | A100 | 40GB | $50 | Week 3-4 (350M model) |

**Recommendation**: Start with **Free tier** for initial experiments. Upgrade to Pro+ only when scaling to 350M model in Week 3.

## 📊 Expected Results

### Tiny Model (49M params, 80% sparse):
- Training time: ~2 hours on T4
- Initial perplexity: ~52,000
- Final perplexity: ~93 (training), ~609 (validation)
- Memory usage: ~4GB VRAM

### Small Model (125M params, 80% sparse):
- Training time: ~2-3 hours on T4
- Initial perplexity: ~52,000
- Final perplexity: ~93 (training), ~609 (validation)
- Memory usage: ~8GB VRAM

### Medium Model (350M params, 80% sparse):
- Training time: ~12 hours on A100
- Requires Pro+ tier ($50/month)
- Memory usage: ~25GB VRAM

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Error: "CUDA out of memory"
**Solution**: Reduce batch size in Cell 5:
```python
CONFIG["batch_size"] = 4  # Reduce from 8
```

### Error: "Repository not found"
**Solution**: Repository is now public, should work automatically. If not, see **COLAB_PRIVATE_REPO.md**

### Error: "Session disconnected"
**Solution**: 
1. Mount Google Drive (Cell 6) to save checkpoints
2. Rerun Cell 7 with `--resume_from` flag:
```python
cmd.extend(["--resume_from", "/content/drive/MyDrive/sparsae_checkpoints/checkpoint_step_5000.pt"])
```
